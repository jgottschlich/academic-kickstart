I founded and lead the Machine Programming Research group at Intel Labs.

I am also Intel's lead principal investigator and co-founder of the joint Intel/NSF CAPA research center on programming for heterogeneous systems. I'm the executive director of AI research and development for the PRECISE Center @ University of Pennsylvania (Penn), where I am also the chair of their industrial research board. I also have an appointment as an adjunct assistant professor @ Penn.

My research is focused on machine programming (MP) which is a fusion of machine learning, programming languages, systems, compilers, software/hardware codesign, and formal methods. I try to maintain deep academic and industrial collaborations. If you'd like to learn more, please see our vision paper (joint with MIT): https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3211355

I have around 70 peer reviewed publications and issued patents. I have ~100 patents pending, mostly in the space of AI and MP. I am also the director of Intel's MP intellectual property portfolio.
